**_IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER!!_** This is not a secure application, or a secure or recommended way of encrypting data, it's a simple demo to illustrate the principles only. Do not use this a secure encryption example / reference code for a secure system in any way. Please refer to the numerous articles and info on encryption and security on the interwebs for that!

## Contains
- /public = CSS (stylesheet)
- /views = ejs based index.html page
- /controllers = controller code with HTTP UI rendering and encryption code
- app.js main app code

## Functionality:
- **encrypt** plaintext to cipher using password/secret (AES)
- **decrypt** cipher to plaintext using password/secret (AES)
- **hash** plaintext, using an optional password/secret (SHA-2)
- **rsa key generation** create private and public keys
- **rsa encryption** using public key
- **rsa decryption** using private key
